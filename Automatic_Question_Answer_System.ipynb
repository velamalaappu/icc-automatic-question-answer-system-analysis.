Continuous learning can be organized by getting feedback from users. For now, the quality of this model can’t outperform people, but it is really close to it (70–80%) depending on a dataset. Every month the quality of such models increases. It means that in the very near future such models may answer questions with the same accuracy as humans, but much faster."
